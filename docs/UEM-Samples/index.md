## Workspace ONE UEM Samples

| Sample Name | Summary | Link |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| Adobe Products | When deploying Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) products with Workspace ONE UEM, admins should strongly consider using the integrated munki functionality built into "Internal Apps."   By using Internal Apps, admins gain the benefit of code which already understands the unique nature of the Creative Cloud app packages and handles them appropriately.  That said, as a macOS administrator, there is still some manual work which must be done to deliver these Adobe CC packages successfully. | [Link](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Apps/Adobe%20Products) |
| AppBlocker_WS1 | The included .pkg and .plist files can be uploaded directly to the Workspace ONE Adminsitrator Console, and pre-install and post-uninstall scripts can be configured to easily specify which applications (identified by their Bundle IDs) should not be launched.  If a specified application is launched, the user will receive an alert and the application process will be killed. | [Link](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Apps/AppBlocker_WS1) |

| Legacy App Catalog Webclip For All Docks | The App Catalog webclip is comprised of just a specific url for the device to retrieve the list of available applications. This package dynamically creates this url, and the webclip (.webloc file) and saves it to `/Users/Shared/VMware` with permissions readable by all users. It also places a global LaunchAgent to load on *every user's next login*, to run another script to place the webclip on the user's dock. Once the webclip is added to the dock, a runonce file is created at `~/.appcatalog_runonce` to prevent the script from running again and creating duplicate webclips on the dock. | [Link](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Apps/Legacy%20App%20Catalog%20Webclip%20For%20All%20Docks) |

| Microsoft Office for Mac | Microsoft Office for Mac can be distributed in one of two ways:  App Store and non-Store (via Office.com downloads).  In general, Omnissa recommends deploying Microsoft Office from the Mac App Store (via device-based licensing through Apple Business Manager) unless any of the following apply: | [Link](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Apps/Microsoft%20Office%20for%20Mac) |
| Microsoft-Defender-ATP | If you want to distribute Microsoft Defender ATP for macOS via WorkspaceOne in an enterprise environment you need 2 plist at the end which you distribute via the custom settings in WS1 and which are located in the /Libray/Managed Preferences/.  On the one hand you need the onboarding info, which contains the license for Defender ATP, on the other hand you need the configuration settings. In addition you have to define the system extension policy, kernel extension policy and the privacy preferences. | [Link](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Apps/Microsoft-Defender-ATP) |
| Mozilla Firefox | Firefox for Enterprise allows administrators to manage certain settings within the browser.  It also provides the flexibility for admins to better control the browser release cadence within their organization by adopting either the rapid release or the extended support release.   One item to note is that policy availability does differ between the two releases.   Policies for macOS are now deployed via a mobileconfig file (or via profile payloads in your MDM).  Be mindful of which policies you wish to deploy, as some are only available for the Extended Support Release (ESR) version of Firefox. | [Link](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Apps/Mozilla%20Firefox) |

| Creating_Lookup_Values_through_Custom_Attributes | When deploying any type of macOS script (ie: preinstall, postinstall, or a standalone script) through Workspace ONE, there may be situations where you need to programmatically reference user- or device-specific informations within the script itself.  Custom Attributes can be created to define this information in a way that can be looked up on each device within the script itself. | [Link](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Custom%20Attributes/Creating_Lookup_Values_through_Custom_Attributes) |
| Kernel Extensions Custom Attributes | This shell script (kext-ca.sh) generates an array of 3rd-party loaded Kernel Extensions and writes each kernel extension ID as a Custom Attribute in the local macOS CustomAttributes plist.   This information is posted by the agent back to the AirWatch console.   Admins can then view the list of custom attributes at Devices > Staging & Provisioning > Custom Attributes > List View.   Additionally, admins can filter for the kernel extensions ("com.") and export the list for use in populating the Kernel Extensions payload. | [Link](https://github.com/euc-oss/euc-samples/tree/main/UEM-Samples/Custom%20Attributes/Kernel%20Extensions%20Custom%20Attributes) |
